# sudoku

code will use the 4x4 index from the grid and randomly generate a number in it.
than that number will be run throught the backtracking algorithm to solve it and than that will solve and create the remaining grid that will return 17 spots to the user.


the algorithm will work generating a random number at the first spot.
it than iterate through to the next box from left to right.
the conditons will be that all numbres in that 3 by 3 radius and same row/ column will be checked.
if the number is found to be repeated than will generate on to fill in that hasn't already been seen.
